- Changed the layout of the promotional blocks in the main menu.

- Increased stability of loading of older save files.

- A frame-perfect click at the logo screen could crash the game.

- Fixed an Apostle legacy bug that made it impossible to heal followers wounded by an enemy Long - but only if you were playing a localized (non-English) version of the game. No words enough to convey how hard the Devil worked to make this bug possible.

- Some sounds - namely, a card dropping in a slot, and a game speed being changed via a hotkefy - were not playing since god knows when.

- Improved performance in Exile when arriving in a new city with a lot of cash.

- Fixed a rare bug that broke the main menu if you were mashing buttons too eagerly during the splash screen.

- Fixed an erroneous text display in various escaped spirit hauntings.

- There was a missing colon in a substantial Edge commission's label. Could this be the very last typo in the entire game ?! Will you be able, oh dear players, to spot more ?!

- MODDING: IDs of entities are now completely case-insensitive for all purposes (in-game access, modifying, inheriting, localizing etc).

- MODDING: (super nerdy) Console autocomplete suggestions are now only displayed if there's more than 3 characters typed in - this way you aren't presented to choose from every entity in the game that starts with a letter E.

- HOTFIX A.2: Chinese translation is correctly applied to verbs' initial slots once again.

- A.3: Apostle-specific spirits are now correctly killed in a Starlight confrontation.

- Added 150% UI scale.

- Added a Font Size setting. May lead to stranger looks on higher ends.

- MODDING: 'Sort' property for Elements, a string, the format is 'group.order' - ex. 'a1.z1'. Controls the order of Aspects appearance in card and situation info. Aspects are first sorted by 'group', then by 'order', then, within the same order, by the amount of aspect present, starting with the highest.
	- Several important Aspects are now sorted.

This leaves us fixing such critical bugs such as:

- A bug with keybinds showing default values until you loaded the tabletop at least once.

- A bug when cancelling a key rebind resulted in keyboard controls not working anymore.

- A bug when using ESC key in the main menu would not close an opened dialog.

- A few typos in mod loading logs.

- Fixed empty description in Starvation verb.

- Yet another fix for GOG achievements not unlocking on the storefront side despite being unlocked in the Collection.

- Greedy slots don't bug out on low framerates.

- When a recipe warmup ends, any card-to-slot travel animation aimed at it completes instead of failing.

- Zoom keys (Q/E by default) work sensibly at last - holding results in a continuous zoom instead of having to tap.

- HOTFIX: Verb SFXes work once again.

- Fixed 'Our Enemy's Indentity' description.

- Fixed an assortment of memory leaks.

- Cards in verb slots and outputs don't play their decay animation if the verb window is closed.

- Small rework of the influences' upgrade and subversion:
	- Interactions with Contentment are less erratic.
	- The Lore slot doesn't spoil lore fragments' descriptions.

- Verb windows now display text in a consistent size and use scrollbars if it doesn't fit.

- Experimental changes in the flow of timers.

- Alt recipes correctly display their deck draws (instead of displaying the main recipe's deck draws).

- Fixed an incorrect description in the Russian localization of the Younger Sister.

- Fixed a verb timer sometimes not assuming the correct colour.

- Restored a special audio cue for the Time verb.

- Cards in the Mansus disappear dramatically again.

- Cards in the Mansus are flipped before vanishing - that was an accidental change, sorry!

- Added a description for missing Essential slot requirements.

- Escape button does not close an opened verb window while the settings window is open.

- Exile cities are properly highlighted and faded once again.

- Cards in verbs don't occasionally jump when clicked.

- Streamlined the pause behaviour in the Mansus and settings menu.

- Fixed the Mansus portal window not closing under mysterious circumstances.

- Fix for cards sometimes thinking that they occupy slightly more space than they are in reality, and thus preventing cards to be placed in a space near them, despite it being actually empty.

- At some point, cards that were supposed to be invisible - but only inside verbs - became also invisible on the table - but, like, confusingly invisible. Now visible again, as they always were.

- MODDING: An order in which element's aspects react to xtriggers is now consistent (by id, alphabetical).

- MODDING: Entities now have a '$depends' and '$incompatible' property - a list of mod ids that are required/forbidden for this entity definition to be applied. More specifically, $depends mean 'all listed mods must be enabled', and $incompatible means 'none of listed mods must be enabled'.\nMod id is taken from serapeum_catalogue_number.txt in the mod's folder - it is created automatically on first Workshop upload, but can be created manually for non-Steam users. If no file is present, mod id equals its name.

- MODDING: Custom input settings now work properly.

- MODDING: Aspect xtriggers are significantly reworked - this was an obscure feature and it collected dust for years, but now, hopefully, assumed its final form:
	- All aspects of a card now react to xtriggering (previously only mutations did).
	- The 'Transform' morph effect now transforms a card, even when triggered by an aspect. This way, all morph effects work uniformly, regardless of where they are defined.

- MODDING: The new 'xexts' property on the elements. A string-string pair, works in a way similar to xtriggers - whenever a card meets a key-catalyst of an xext, it displays the description of this xext in its current verb.

- MODDING: Fixed a bug when using an expulsion on an instant additional recipe didn't work.

- MODDING: $plus/$minus work again.

- MODDING: Levers now can have default values, and you can change default values of vanilla levers.

- MODDING: Card labels display rich text correctly.",

- The status bar doubled the displayed number of exhausted Passions.

- The volume of the SFX for entering and exiting the Mansus is halved.

- Disabled camera's motions on entering and exiting the Mansus.

- The legacy selection screen won't suggest you to select from two Exiles anymore.

- FEATURE: Multidrag now works properly at last. Select multiple cards while holding the SHIFT key and drag them as a group.

- HOTFIX: Dropzones aren't blocking card interactions once again.

- MODDING: $plus and $minus now correctly parse values without \"\".

- MODDING: $append and $prepend now correctly work on uninitialized lists.

- MODDING: Recipe 'Xpans' property, which runs xtriggers on all cards on the table (as opposed to 'aspects', which applies them inside the current verb only).

- MODDING: Status bar elements can now be defined more flexibly. Consult with Aspirant legacy in JSONs for an example. A brief rundown of properties:
 	- 'Ids' specifies elements that are tracked by this status bar entry.
	- 'Format' allows to specify any additional characters that accompay the value display. '({value})' meants the value is displayed in brackets, ''-{value}' means it's preceded by dash/minu, etc. Keep in mind that you can use TextMeshPro rich text tags, same as everywhere else in the texts.
	- 'Icon', naturally, defines an icon. If not defined, the first entry in 'Ids' is used instead.
	- 'Styles' allows to modify value's display at certain numbers. Currently, there are only possible two modes, that look like 'colour_red_0' and 'hide_0'. The first makes the display red when it equals 0, and the second hides it under the same conditions. Note that you can use any value instead of 0, and any colour instead of red - defined as a plain string colour name, or a hex code.
	A simple string definition is still possible too, of course.",
